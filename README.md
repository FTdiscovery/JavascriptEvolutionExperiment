An evolution simulator created in JavaScript. The entities use neural networks created using a genetic algorithm.

Modified the original code of John Hess's Evolution simulator, with more "creatures" and bigger brains. Took 96 hours for them to learn to eat  the food, (very slow). The video shows development at 150 hours. 

Note that left hand circles seem to be the current best strategy to  get food at this stage and none of the creatures cross the boundary at the edge of screen, even though they can tel-port ..

It should be noted the first time it was run it only took 48 hours for the bigger brains to find the food, so you might have more luck starting a couple.
